As with lab2, copy my redfibo_ref.pyc and tb_redfibo.py to wherever you keep your redfibo.py
(e.g., cp redfibo_ref.pyc ~/lab3; cp tb_redfibo.py ~/lab3)

then run the following to run some preliminary tests:
python tb_redfibo.py

Your score should be 100.0% if all correct ... otherwise, you'll see the percentage of
what you got correct
